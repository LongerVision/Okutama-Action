## Okutama-Action: An Aerial View Video Dataset for Concurrent Human Action Detection

#### Abstract

_We present Okutama-Action, a new video dataset foraerial view concurrent human action detection.  It consistsof 43 minute-long fully-annotated sequences with 12 actionclasses. Okutama-Action features many challenges missingin current datasets, including dynamic transition of actions,significant changes in scale and aspect ratio, abrupt cam-era movement, as well as multi-labeled actors.  As a result,our dataset is more challenging than existing ones, and willhelp push the field forward to enable real-world applica-tions._
